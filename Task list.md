High priority
- [ ] An overview of the project without too many technical details (user guide documentation
- [x] Create a qip_opt branch and apply the changes
- [x] Combining two coefficients with different tlist in the noise object 
- [x] Example of noise on a simple qubit circuit

Low priority
- [ ] Blog about git commands
- [ ] Fused Cython type in `inter.pyx`
- [ ] Combining two coefficients with different tlist in QobjEvo

Ideals
- [ ] A citcuit optimizer combining gates such as Hardamard on each qubits in to one gate for OptPulseProcessor
- [ ] Allow different `n_ts` and `evo_time` for different gates in OptPulseProcessor
