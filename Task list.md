High priority
- [ ] An overview of the project without too many technical details
- [x] Create a qip_opt branch and apply the changes
- [ ] Combining two coefficients with different tlist in QobjEvo
- [x] Example of noise on a simple qubit circuit

Low priority
- [ ] Blog about git commands
- [ ] Fused Cython type in `inter.pyx`

Ideals
- [ ] A citcuit optimizer combining gates such as Hardamard on each qubits in to one gate for OptPulseProcessor
- [ ] Allow different `n_ts` and `evo_time` for different gates in OptPulseProcessor
